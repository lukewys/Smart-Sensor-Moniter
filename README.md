Search and connect all the IP created by different sensors in the current LAN.

This is a assignment from Measurement and Control software design practice in Automation institute, BUPT.

## Component

The sensor monitor system is composed in three parts: sensor server, moniter system and database system.

The sensor server is implimented by me, while other parts is implimented by Yang Nie. 

The sensor server is build on raspberry-pi, and the sensors I used are DHT11, HC-SR04, HC-SR501, DS18B20.
